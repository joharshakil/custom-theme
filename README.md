## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joharshakil/custom-theme.git
````

### 2. Move the Theme to Your Project

If you're using **WordPress**, place it inside:

```
wp-content/themes/custom-theme/
```

Otherwise, simply drop it into your web root or project folder.

### 3. Activate the Theme

* Go to your WordPress Dashboard → Appearance → Themes → **Activate Custom Theme**
* Or, open `index.html` / your entry page directly if this is a static site.

---

## ⚙️ Customization

You can easily modify the theme to fit your project:

* **Colors & Fonts** → Update `style.css` or files in `/css`
* **Logos & Images** → Replace files inside `/images`
* **Layout Changes** → Edit `header.php`, `footer.php`, `page.php`, etc.
* **Scripts** → Add or modify JavaScript inside `/js`
* **Right-to-Left Support** → Enable or adjust `rtl.css` for Arabic/Hebrew sites

---

## 💻 For Developers

If you’re extending this as a WordPress theme:

* Update `style.css` header comments (Theme Name, Author, Version).
* Add or modify hooks in `functions.php`.
* Use `get_template_part()` for reusable sections in `/includes`.
* Follow WP coding standards for best compatibility.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

* PHP 7.4+ (for WordPress)
* A local server (XAMPP, WAMP, Laragon, or MAMP)
* Basic HTML/CSS knowledge

---

## 🧪 Optional: Use Docker

If you have a Docker setup, you can run your WordPress site easily:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

## 🧠 Tips

* Always keep a backup before modifying core theme files.
* Use a **child theme** for major design or functionality changes.
* Minify your CSS/JS files for production.
* Optimize images to keep your site lightweight.

## 🎨 Final Note

This theme is built to give you a strong starting point for your next project.
Tweak it, extend it, make it yours — and build something awesome! 🚀

```

Would you like me to make a **WordPress-specific version** (with theme header comments for `style.css`, like `Theme Name`, `Author`, etc.) so it’s instantly installable as a WP theme?
